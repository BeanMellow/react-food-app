# Meal Planning App with landing page
## Work in progress
### My second project in React. Features:
* routing (**React Router**)
* **Cloud Firestore** database integration
* forms (add recipes and meal plans):
  * validation
  * data saved in Firestore
* tables (recipes and plans):
  * data loaded from Firestore
  * edit and delete functions

### How to install:
1. `https://github.com/BeanMellow/react-meal-planning-app.git`
2. `cd react-meal-planning-app`
3. `npm i`

Then `npm start` for development mode, and `npm run build` for production.

In development mode, localhost server will run on `localhost:8080` with autoreloading.
